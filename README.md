# icsfilter

icsfilter provides a basic way to filter events or change wording in ics files using the command line. In addition to local files it also works with online ics calendars that you can't otherwise change the output of.

In combination with launchd and [ControlPlane](http://www.controlplaneapp.com/) it's proven to be very useful to me. See [screenshots here](#screenshots).




## Screenshots

Personally, I use icsfilter for both my university and work calendars. These screenshots show the calendars before and after:
